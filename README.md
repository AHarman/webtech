A project created for a course in web technologies, using Node.js. The result is a website and library system for the
University of Bristol Tolkien Society.

The information contained in this website may be out of date or lacking (the library only contains a fraction of the books acutally owned by the society), please do not use this as an authoritive source.

A hosted version can be found at [tolkien.alexharman.uk](http://tolkien.alexharman.uk)

To install and run this project:

* Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed on your system.
* Use the command `node install` in the folder that contains the project.
* Use the command `nodejs private/database.js` to perform the first time set up of the database.
* To start the project enter `nodejs server.js`. 
* I recommend using [PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/) or a similar tool to ensure that the Node.js process is restarted if needbe and to keep it running in the background.
